Hi Team, Just wanted to follow up on the proposal. We had a meeting scheduled with the client next week, and Iâ€™d like to finalize things by Friday.

Hey, the design team shared updated mockups. They're attached. Please review and give feedback by Thursday.

Following up, the legal team had a few concerns about the third-party terms. I've added their comments to the shared doc.

All, final version is now in the drive. Let me know if I should proceed to send it.
